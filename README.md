# TournamentMaker
Tournament maker is a website designed for creating League of Legends teams and tournaments. It's created by [Thom](https://github.com/lantaarnappel "Thom") and [Nico](https://github.com/koffielyder "Nico"), with help from Simon. 

Tournament maker is currently in alpha, and not hosted anywhere. Our deadline is 7-7-2015.

The program is created in Laraveld.
